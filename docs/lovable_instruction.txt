### Lovable – Custom Build Instruction

1. **Read the four spec files in `/docs/` *every time* you generate or modify code.**
   * `masterplan.txt` – goals, architecture, risks.
   * `implementation-plan.txt` – repo layout, phased roadmap, endpoints.
   * `design-guidelines.txt` – colour, typography, component and accessibility rules.
   * `app-flow-pages-and-roles.txt` – routes, page duties, permissions.

2. **Aggressively follow DRY and Single Source of Truth.**
   * Re‑use helpers; no duplicated logic or styles.
   * Data lives in `/data/oewg_analysis_dash.db`; analytics logic in `/python-svc/`; UI state derives from React hooks.

3. **Follow test driven development (TDD)**
   * Consult testing_guidelines.txt for how to implement a TDD approach.

4. **Workflow:**
   * Parse docs → build only what the current phase allows.
   * Validate changes against spec files docs; ask for clarification if conflicts arise.
   * Output clean, commented code adhering to Prettier/Black.
